			PREAMBLE
		</h3>

		<p>
			The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how theseaspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without theaspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, theaspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and thedetails form a cohesive code.
